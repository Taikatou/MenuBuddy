MenuBuddy
=========

MenuBuddy is library for doing menus in XNA and MonoGame.

Based on the famous NetworkStateManagement samples.

This library has been tested on Windows and Ouya.  Other platforms supported by XNA and MonoGame would be easy to implement.

Note: This lib uses a couple of submodules, so make sure to run "git submodule init; git submodule update" after cloning.
